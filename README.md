## Week 4

### Summary

> TODO: upon week completion

### Goals

- [x] Explore "big" data-visualizers such as wandb.ai and tableau

### 2021-06-28

> **Day 15 `Monday June 28th, 2021` `7hr`**

- Searched for time tracking methods (time-warrior seems to work well for me)
- Began looking into wandb.ai
  - Read through documentation
  - Viewed featured projects for direction
  - Made a sample oscillation trial
  - [Link to project](https://wandb.ai/ampersand/oscillation_1)


## Week 3

### Summary

> TODO: upon week completion

### Goals

- [ ] Wrap up visualizer
- [ ] Strip down Dr. Yoder's ctrnn python library to bare-bones
  - [x] Base ctrnn functionality
  - [x] `Evaluator` abstract class for creating different training metrics
  - [ ] abstract class for creating different learning methods
- [ ] Different learning algorithms
  - [ ] Random sampling
  - [ ] Random walker
  - [ ] Random hillclimber

### 2021-06-27

> **Day 14 `Sunday June 27th, 2021` `3hr`**

- Finished writing the `Oscillator` `Evaluator` method with some tests
- Began planning the abstract class to allow for different learning algorithms

### 2021-06-25

> **Day 13 `Friday June 25th, 2021` `5hr`**

- Planned out structure for the `Evaluator` abstract class
  - Any class extending `Evaluator` would have 5 abstract methods:
    `pre_transient`, `step_transient`,  `pre_evaluation`, `step_evaluation`,
    and `generate_report`. By overriding these, we can configure different
    desired network behaviors, as opposed to oscillation
- Began and completed the `Evaluator` abstract class
- Planned and started `Oscillator` class, implementing `Evaluator`

### 2021-06-24

> **Day 12 `Thursday June 24th, 2021` `4hr`**

- Created checklist for the ctrnn python library
- Started working on the ctrnn python library
  - Completed the base ctrnn functionality
  - Included some test cases for safety, but I plan to add more later

### 2021-06-22

> **Day 11 `Tuesday June 22th, 2021` `4hr`**

- Fixed phase portrait's inverted y-axis
- Began implementing a timestep slider (still WIP)
- Began writing an interface for different fitness landscape paths

### 2021-06-21

> **Day 10 `Monday June 21th, 2021` `8hr`**

- Implemented a path plot to the visualizer's phase portrait
- Used this plot to determine what was wrong with the vector field
  - In the end it was me not taking into account the biases when converting
    from regular space to sigmoid space (phase portrait issue only)
- Skimmed a few of the papers related to the Microbial Genetic Algorithm paper
- Began taking a deeper look into Dr. Yoder's `ctrnn_bio_rl` code

## Week 2

### Summary

> TODO: upon week completion

### Goals

- [x] Provide a visualization of the library for demonstration purposes
- [x] Write a PhasePortrait React component
- [x] Replace live neuron view with phase portrait
- [x] Begin reading about Microbial Genetic Algorithms

### 2021-06-18

> **Day 9 `Friday June 18th, 2021` `4hr`**

- Read through The Microbial Genetic Algorithm multiple times to verify my
  understanding of the concept before putting it to use.

### 2021-06-17

> **Day 8 `Thursday June 17th, 2021` `10hr`**

- Rewrote code to accept new external node activation array system
- Wrote a React component that renders a phase portrait using HTML canvas
- Made visualizer iterate over a 20x20 grid of starting activations, and graph
  their outputs from the ctrnn on the phase portrait
- Made the phase portrait update in realtime on changes to the parameters

### 2021-06-16

> **Day 7 `Wednesday June 16th, 2021` `9hr`**

- Began rewriting ctrnn library to use an external node activation array
  - This is preferable as it allows for an easy way to test what the outcome
    would be from all possible states.
- Began using this new external node activation array for the phase portrait
- Began working on the visuals of the phase portrait
- (now there is an empty space on the visualizer, perhaps we can put some other
  statistic/view there in the future)

### 2021-06-14

> **Day 6 `Monday June 14th, 2021` `10hr`**

[`cooperuser.dev/ctrnn-visualizer`]: https://cooperuser.dev/ctrnn-visualizer

- Provided a realtime view of the oscillatory behavior in the visualizer
- Created a parameters panel that allows the user to configure the network
- Created a static view of the first seconds of simulation of the network
  - Smooth continuous updates when the user alters a parameter
- Expose at a public url [`cooperuser.dev/ctrnn-visualizer`]
  - Secure with an SSL certificate (HTTPS protocol)

## Week 1

### Summary

> TODO: upon week completion

### Goals

- [x] Grasp a deeper understanding of the research projectâ€™s underlying concepts
- [x] Develop a CTRNN library in JavaScript/TypeScript
- [ ] Provide a visualization of the library for demonstration purposes

### 2021-06-11

> **Day 5 `Friday June 11th, 2021` `7hr`**

- Succeeded in having [`ctrnn.js`] mimic the behavior of [`madvn/CTRNN`]
  - Network now allows for sinusoidal behavior instead of steady state
- Started integrating the graph/histogram for [`ctrnn-visualizer`]
- Read/skimmed through the next 2 resources

### 2021-06-10

> **Day 4 `Thursday June 10th, 2021` `5hr`**

[`madvn/CTRNN`]: https://github.com/madvn/CTRNN

- Read/skimmed through the first 5 resources supplied by Dr. Yoder
- Analyzed the [`madvn/CTRNN`] python library
  - Started using the readme's example as a model for [`ctrnn.js`]

### 2021-06-09

> **Day 3 `Wednesday June 9th, 2021` `7hr`**

- Organized journal to log my progress
  - Time tracking is still done manually, I hope to make it more streamline
- Began brainstorming a `rl-ctrnn` library that runs on top of [`ctrnn.js`]
- Skimmed through some of the references Dr. Yoder linked to for the research
- Continued work on the interface for [`ctrnn-visualizer`]
  - I want to get a working version first that does supports basic
    non-reinforcement learning CTRNN models
  - I plan to incorporate the oscillating weights RL model after this prototype

### 2021-06-08

> **Day 2 `Tuesday June 8th, 2021` `6hr`**

[`ctrnn.js`]: https://github.com/cooper-anderson/ctrnn.js
[`ctrnn-visualizer`]: https://github.com/cooper-anderson/ctrnn-visualizer

- Looked into how "common" CTRNN libraries allow the user to interface
- Created a custom [`ctrnn.js`] library outline tailored to our needs
  - Not fully completed yet, and still needs more test cases
- Started work on [`ctrnn-visualizer`] to go along with [`ctrnn.js`]
  - Mainly waiting for the completion of the backend

### 2021-06-07

> **Day 1 `Monday June 7th, 2021` `7hr`**

- Read through research proposal document
- Read documentation on existing CTRNN implementations in JS
  - Decided to write a library from scratch as no existing libraries fit our
  needs without a decent amount of integration
- Began brainstorming different ways of displaying information to the user for
  the CTRNN visualizer
- Began brainstorming which aspects/parameters the user should be able to
  control in the visualizer
