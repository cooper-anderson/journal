## Week 1

### Summary

Sample summary.

### Goals

- [ ] Obtain a deep understanding of the research projectâ€™s underlying concepts
- [ ] Develop a CTRNN library in JavaScript/TypeScript
- [ ] Provide a visualization of the library for demonstration purposes

### Day 1 `2021-06-07` `7hr`

- Read through research proposal document
- Read documentation on existing CTRNN implementations in JS
- Decided to write a library from scratch as no existing libraries fit our
  needs without a decent amount of integration
- Began brainstorming different ways of displaying information to the user for
  the CTRNN visualizer
- Began brainstorming which aspects/parameters the user should be able to
  control in the visualizer
