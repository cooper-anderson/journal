- Organized journal to log my progress
  - Time tracking is still done manually, I hope to make it more streamline
- Began brainstorming a `rl-ctrnn` library that runs on top of [`ctrnn.js`]
- Skimmed through some of the references Dr. Yoder linked to for the research
- Continued work on the interface for [`ctrnn-visualizer`]
  - I want to get a working version first that does supports basic
    non-reinforcement learning CTRNN models
  - I plan to incorporate the oscillating weights RL model after this prototype

- Looked into how "common" CTRNN libraries allow the user to interface
- Created a custom [`ctrnn.js`] library outline tailored to our needs
  - Not fully completed yet, and still needs more test cases
- Started work on [`ctrnn-visualizer`] to go along with [`ctrnn.js`]
  - Mainly waiting for the completion of the backend

> **Day 1 `Monday June 7th, 2021` `7hr`**

- Read through research proposal document
- Read documentation on existing CTRNN implementations in JS
- Decided to write a library from scratch as no existing libraries fit our
  needs without a decent amount of integration
- Began brainstorming different ways of displaying information to the user for
  the CTRNN visualizer
- Began brainstorming which aspects/parameters the user should be able to
  control in the visualizer
